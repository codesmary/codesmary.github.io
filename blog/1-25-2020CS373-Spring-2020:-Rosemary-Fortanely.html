			<p><img src='/static/rosemary.jpeg' border='5px' align='left' class='border'> Okay, so I guess this is the part         where I talk about myself. I grew up in the Austin area, but more specifically Pflugerville for people         that are actually from the Austin area. I went to three high schools (whee!), Pflugerville         High School, then Texas Connections Academy, then Pflugerville again, and then Hendrickson High         School. During this time I spent a lot of time not being particularly academically interested, until         I took a physics class and realized that problem solving was actually something I found quite exciting.         After this point I was in a handful of activities: Art club, Karate, and UIL CS/Math. I actually ended         up coming to UT after being CAPped to UT Arlington for a year and somehow managed to transfer in. I was         one of the lucky ones, I guess! I'm majoring in CS because I thought I wanted to be a EE major after my         physics courses, but then realized CS is a lot cooler, haha. Thanks older brother!        <br><br>I'm taking SWE because I heard Downing was a professor that was a 'must-take'.         I think I'm already pretty well-versed with full-stack web apps. I built this website and am generally pretty         good with Flask/Database technologies/HTML/CSS. I think the only thing I'm weaker on is React and JS related         web technologies. I thought the first couple of lectures were fine. I was mostly dredding getting cold called,         but that hasn't happened yet!         <br><br>I'm having a pretty good time because I'm currently at TAMUhack. Although I'm dreading         what the sleep situation will be like since my Airbnb fell through, I'm quite happy with what         I've accomplished. It's a tool that's meant to help blind people, a <a         href='https://github.com/codesmary/PixReader'>screen reader</a> that not only reads text, but also 'reads'         images through the use of computer vision. I finished my project within the first 5 hours, so now I'm just         working on this blog post, haha. That was pretty satisfying since I've never finished such a lofty project so         fast!         <br><br>My tip of the week is don't trust everything you see online. I was trying to use a         pretrained model that seemed to provide great results on the blog post about it, but after I         spent forever trying to get it to work, it output captions for images as primitive as 'adult'         and 'cat'. Such a bummer.</p>
