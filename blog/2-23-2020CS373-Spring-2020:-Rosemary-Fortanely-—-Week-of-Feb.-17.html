			<h2>2-23-2020</h2>
			<p><img src='/static/rosemary.jpeg' align='left' class='border'>    <b>1. What did you do this past week?</b>    <br><br>This past week I’ve been doing a lot of graphic design work and front-end development for our website. I’ve designed the home page, the about page, and the search page, as well as completed the corresponding code for those, sans the search page. It was also my first time creating vector graphics. Even though the designs I made were really simple, I enjoyed learning about that since it’s been a goal of mine for a while to improve on that skill so I can make more engaging websites.    <br><br><b>2. What's in your way?</b>    <br><br>I think the main thing making it hard to work right now is stress. I like having things done early and it’s been stressing me out not having control over that and waiting for things to fall into place. There’s also been some miscommunication and people haven’t been making issues besides me and Connor which makes it hard to tell who’s working on what.    <br><br><b>3. What will you do next week?</b>    <br><br>At this point, I’m not sure what will be my next work item, if any. I suppose this will be solidified at our meeting we’re having this Monday.    <br><br><b>4. What was your experience of iteration, AWS, and Chef Secure?</b>    <br><br>I thought some of the tricks we went over during the iteration lecture were neat, such as how an iterator of an iterator will always return an iterator. I was surprised at how much effort goes into hosting since before I had only ever used tools like Heroku and GitHub Pages which made hosting straightforward, so I’m hoping our guys working on hosting can get through that okay. The mini security lecture from the CEO of Chef Secure has given me a new perspective on vulnerabilities online.    <br><br><b>5. What made you happy this week?</b>    Today, my boyfriend, Connor, and I went to Michi Ramen off Lamar and I got some yummy ramen and fries. Even though we had just been there last week for Valentine’s Day, I still enjoyed it because they have top tier tofu.    <br><br><b>6. What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>     <br><br>Marvel App is a nice tool for creating mock-ups that I’ve used for this and a couple of previous web design projects, and I’ve found it helpful to have something a little more concrete than just making a rough sketch on paper.</p>
