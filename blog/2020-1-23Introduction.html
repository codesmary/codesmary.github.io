			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<h2>2020-1-23</h2>
			<p>Hello everyone!<br><br>Today is the first day of my blog being up and running :D         After lots of fiddling with Jekyll and eventually giving up, I finally found (what         I hope to be a solution, haven't yet deployed to GitHub Pages) Frozen Flask to be         something that finally worked.<br><br>I've had this webpage as just a static one-pager         for a while now and I was excited to integrate Flask into it and add a database.         Although my solution isn't beautiful, I'm glad to at least have something to call         my own. For now this will primarily be used for blogging for my Software Engineering         class (gotta get that writing flag!), but I'm hoping along the way I can also use this         as a landing page for thoughts about personal projects, hackathons, or anything else         interesting that comes up with me :) <br><br>That's all for now, have a good day!</p>
