			<h1>CS373 Spring 2020: Rosemary Fortanely — Week of Feb. 10</h1>
			<h2>2-15-2020</h2>
			<p><img src='/static/rosemary.jpeg' align='left' class='border'>    <b>1. What did you do this past week?</b>    <br><br>Over the past week, I reviewed the operator material I missed last Friday and also started up on     research with Connor for one of the project ideas for the upcoming website. We created the scheme for a     few models, including the Pet, Breed, and Shelter model, as well as found a Austin Animal Center dataset     of information over dog and cat intakes at a local shelter and a couple of APIs about cat and dog breeds,     in addition to couple of adoption websites that can be scraped for data to supplement the Austin Animal     Center dog and cat dataset.    <br><br><b>2. What's in your way?</b>    <br><br>Right now the group is mostly just waiting on having our first meeting before we go ahead with     anything. Presumably in this meeting we will go over the results from a poll we set up to decide which     project proposal we liked the most (a few of us proposed the animal adoption website, the Austin music     website, and an exercise sources website), as well as determining what roles each of us want to take     going forward for this first part of the project.    <br><br><b>3. What will you do next week?</b>    <br><br>I am not sure exactly which part of the project I will be working on, but my interests in web     development probably lean more towards back-end development, but I would like to also improve my skills     in front-end development, specifically in React and TypeScript, as well as graphic design.    <br><br><b>4. What was your experience of Project #1: Collatz (the problem, the overkill requirements     of submission, etc.)?</b>    <br><br>I thought Collatz was a fun problem, but I do agree that all of the different tools we had to     use and steps we had to go through to go from finishing the Hackerrank problem to turning in the final     script and tests was kind of overwhelming. I got through it eventually though, and looking back on it,     the hardest part was simply the Hackerrank portion and getting all the tests to pass. I think I just     had a less favorable experience with the software engineering side of things because it felt like a     bit of drudge work.    <br><br><b>5. What made you happy this week?</b>    <br><br>I was having some issues with getting authentication to work with the Spotify API for my     SpotYourFriends side project, but I finally got that fixed so I could deploy it to Heroku and now     it feels like a real thing instead of just a toy website I run from my terminal, which made me feel     really excited!    <br><br><b>6. What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>     <br><br>Heroku is a great tool for getting urls and hosting websites. It’s free at a certain tier     and very straight forward to use!</p>
