			<h1>CS373 Spring 2020: Rosemary Fortanely — Week of Jan. 27</h1>
			<h2>2-2-2020</h2>
			<p><img src='/static/rosemary.jpeg' align='left' class='border'>    <b>1. What did you do this past week?</b>    <br><br>Hello everyone! My past week was     pretty good, I finally got my Collatz implementation working on Hackerrank. It was easy to get it     working, but much harder to add caching and get it efficient enough to pass all three tests. I was     disappointed to find with all the effort I put into the meta-cache, that it slowed down my implementation     so much that it failed the second test, and once I removed it, my code was fast enough to pass it again.     There were certainly some points where I felt like I just wanted to give up, but the tips we went over in     class and the encouragement from my peers really helped.     <br><br><b>2. What's in your way?</b>    <br><br>Realistically, the only thing in my way is my willingness to work, but I'm pushing through it!    <br><br><b>3. What will you do next week?</b>    <br><br>At this point, I've finished the main objective of the assignment, that is, creating a cached     implementation that will find maximum Collatz cycle lengths for a number of ranges. Now I just need to     refactor my code, do testing, and all the other tasks we reviewed in order to closer adhere to the workflow     for this class.     <br><br><b>4. What was your experience with assertions, unit tests, coverage, and continuous integration?</b>    <br><br>I've had experience with all the technologies we talked about this week, but found myself most     comfortable with assertions, as I've worked with them for other classes (primarily in Java), unit tests,     as I've had to create this for previous internships, and continuous integration, as I've found this to be     standard at most places I've worked. It will be interesting to be looking at code coverage in python and     learn more about that.     <br><br><b>5. What made you happy this week?</b>    <img src='/static/city-gouache.jpg' align='left' class='border'>     <br><br>I was happy that I finished a gouache     painting for the first time since last summer. I still have more practice to do since I was hoping for a     more impressionistic style, but that will just take time (and possibly new brushes)!     <br><br><b>6. What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>     <br><br>My pick-of-the-week is laser printing! I found it be a very powerful tool that complements any sort of     encasing you'll need to do for hardware. Just create a box using any online tool and edit to have whatever     sorts of features you need and you're done! I worked with a friend this week to create a prototype box to     hold some hardware for a cat bot I've been working on, and it was a really fun process.</p>
