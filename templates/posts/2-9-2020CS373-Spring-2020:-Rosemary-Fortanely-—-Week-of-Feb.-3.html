			<h1>CS373 Spring 2020: Rosemary Fortanely — Week of Feb. 3</h1>
			<h2>2-9-2020</h2>
			<p><img src='/static/rosemary.jpeg' align='left' class='border'>    <b>1. What did you do this past week?</b>    <br><br>Over this past week, I finished the Collatz project. This involved writing the 15 issues, unit     and acceptance tests, and plugging in my code I had written for Hackerrank into Downing's boilerplate     code. The whole project took me about 5 hours to finish.     <br><br><b>2. What's in your way?</b>    <br><br>I didn't have too many issues with completing these tasks as they weren't as intensive as writing     the code to solve the problem itself. The main thing I had a little bit of trouble with was determining     how to write a unit test that could catch when the code threw a certain exception, but after enough     Googling I figured that out!     <br><br><b>3. What will you do next week?</b>    <br><br>I need to review the notes from Friday with a friend as I had to miss that class, and then I     will begin the second project with my team. I'm excited to get into the meat of this class!    <br><br><b>4. What was your experience of exceptions, types, and operators?</b>    <br><br>I generally find myself using exceptions in code I write for hobby because they are a pretty     helpful tool to trigger certain behaviours if the code breaks and makes debugging much easier. As for     python types and operators, I consider myself pretty comfortable with them as I've slowly grown to adopt     python as my language of choice. I had, however, never heard of frozenset! It was interesting to learn     something new.    <br><br><b>5. What made you happy this week?</b>    <br><br>I travelled to Oklahoma this weekend to participate in Hacklahoma (which is also why I missed     class Friday, as I mentioned), and really enjoyed my time there! They had great food, a fun origami     workshop, and I got to stay in a hotel for a bit and change up my routine. My project I worked on is     called SpotYourFriends, a web app that lets you create playlists with you friends that contain songs     you all have in common. It does this by finding the intersect of all the songs in each user's library     of playlists. It was built with Flask, Spotipy, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can read more about it     and check out the repo <a href='https://devpost.com/software/spotyourfriends'>here</a>.    <br><br><b>6. What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>     <br><br>My pick-of-the-week is Spotipy, a python wrapper for the Spotify Web API. Although it wasn't     perfect, it made working with Spotify for SpotYourFriends pretty easy.</p>
