			<h1>First Iteration of the Stuart Bot!</h1>
			<h2>2020-1-24</h2>
			<p>So I finally got a prototype of the Stuart Bot working that     I'm happy with! If you're not sure what I'm talking about, the Stuart Bot is     essentially a webcam I have pointed at my boyfriend's apartment's resident cat     and it takes a picture of him every so often. I'm soon to be moving in with them,     so this very may well be quite a long-term project!<br><br>I was having some issues     with finding a model that would work well for this. At first I was trying to use a pre-trained     model in OpenCV as per <a href='https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/06/20/detecting-cats-in-images-with-opencv/'>this tutorial</a>.     I was having a lot of difficulty having it even detect Stuart and got a couple of positives, but     other than that, just not a lot of luck. Finally I switched over to ResNet-50 and this was great,     because where the OpenCV model could only (barely) detect only cat faces, ResNet-50 was really good     at detecting faces and bodies from all sorts of perspectives. This made it a lot easier for the twitter bot     to work since Stuart usually sits in weird contorted positions in the bean bag, haha.<br><br> If you     want to check out the code it's in this <a href='https://github.com/codesmary/Stuart-Bot'>repo</a> and if you     just want to look at cute cat pictures the twitter bot can be found <a href='https://twitter.com/TheStuartBot'>here</a>.</p>
