What did you do this past week?</b>    <br><br>I spent the last week helping some of the other people on my team with cleaning     up their pages, specifically our model and instance pages. I fixed the layout of the     pages and changed the styles to match our theme. I’m hoping we can have an attractive     website at the end of this project, and something we can all be proud of.    <br><br><b>2. What's in your way?</b>    <br><br>Time was the main constraint. It would get stressful when people would put off     committing code until closer to the deadline and there would be changes I wanted to     make, but minimal time to spend to making them before it had to be done for Phase 1.    <br><br><b>3. What will you do next week?</b>    <br><br>My team is hopefully meeting on Tuesday, and at that point we will be having a     retro for Phase 1 and going over the tasks for Phase 2 and breaking them down. My goal     is to work on the back-end since I have substantial experience with Flask and     SQLAlchemy (I even already use them for this website!)    <br><br><b>4. What was your experience of comprehensions, generators, and yield?</b>    <br><br>I love comprehensions. I was first exposed to them when I started with     competitive programming in python as a Freshman in college and I thought back then it     was the coolest thing. I was surprised that map and reduce are implemented as generators     just because I don’t use them very often to begin with, and I had never read that before.     I had also seen yield before, but didn’t entirely understand the difference between it     and ‘return’. I had thought I was already a pretty skilled python developer before this     class, but our lectures have been great to learn and show me just how much I didn’t know.    <br><br><b>5. What made you happy this week?</b>    <br><br>I just joined the club Freetail Hackers this semester and we put on our spring     hackathon, LeapHacks, this last Saturday. I enjoyed getting to help with the program and     make new friends while I was there.    <br><br><b>6. What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>     <br><br>My pick-of-the-week is the framework we’re required to use for Phase 2’s back-end,     Flask! I first set out to learn it after seeing it come up again and again in hackathon     projects I’ve seen friends make, and after picking it up, I’ve made many projects with it     myself! It’s relatively straightforward to understand, and it’s a great tool for making     dynamic web apps with.</p>
