			<h2>3-28-2020</h2>
			<p><img src='/static/rosemary.jpeg' align='left' class='border'>    <b>1. Are you and your family safe and sound where you are?</b>    <br><br>Currently, I am by myself in my studio apartment, but I am doing well. I had a group chat with 8 of my other family members earlier this morning and everyone is currently staying put and coronavirus-free, so I count that as a win.    <br><br><b>2. How do feel about your ability to finish the term completely online?</b>    <br><br>I’m kind of worried. I don’t have a great track record for online classes, so I hope that’s not the case this time.    <br><br><b>3. What made you happy this week?</b>    <br><br>I finished a sewing project I had been putting off while school was in session, and gave them to my boyfriend! I used what I thought was a really cute teal fabric with white stars, but all he had to say about it was that it looked patriotic. Oh well. I also bought 7 pairs of earrings in the last 2 days. I haven’t worn earrings in years, but everyone has them on TikTok and I felt inspired to start wearing them.    <br><br><b>4. What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>    <br><br>My tip-of-the-week is to check your Xbox One before buying physical games. My edition doesn’t have a disk drive, which I didn’t realize, and I wasted $40 on Amazon when I should have just bought digital.</p>
