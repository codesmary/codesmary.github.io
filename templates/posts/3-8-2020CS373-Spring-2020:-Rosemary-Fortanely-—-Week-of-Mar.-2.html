			<h1>CS373 Spring 2020: Rosemary Fortanely — Week of Mar. 2</h1>
			<h2>3-8-2020</h2>
			<p><img src='/static/rosemary.jpeg' align='left' class='border'>    <b>1. What did you do this past week?</b>    <br><br>I spent the last week working on the back-end implementation for Phase 2 of our IDB project. I     have been creating the models for the database, as well as writing our Pets4Me API that will be called     by our front-end. Additionally, since there is a test coming up this week, I have been studying old     Hackkerank questions for that. Since all of my notes for this class are only about a page long, I’m     hoping to be able to condense it all into a nice study sheet for the test before Wednesday.    <br><br><b>2. What's in your way?</b>    <br><br>I picked up the tasks I did because I had worked with Flask before so I assumed the way the     routing for the API would work would be the same, but it ended up being different for Flask-Restless     so I had to get accustomed to that. Getting used to that different library was the main obstacle.    <br><br><b>3. What will you do next week?</b>    <br><br>I have to finish writing tests for my API using both unittest and Postman. I feel comfortable     that I'll be able to write unit tests since I have experience with modifying the database and getting     responses from an API, but I'll need to learn about something called 'stubs' I think to be able to finish     those without permanently messing up the database. I'm more worried about using Postman since I haven't     written anything using Postman for a couple of years.    <br><br><b>4. What was your experience of =, *, **, and decorators?</b>    <br><br>I had used = before, but *, **, and decorators were mostly new to me. I had a tough time with the     quiz, but I've been studying for the test and I feel confident that I'll be able to nail it then.    <br><br><b>5. What made you happy this week?</b>    <br><br>My team got our grade back for Phase 1, and I'm glad we did well on our first project. There were     some minor errors, but we discussed them and surely we'll do better next time. We made a pseudo-deadline     for a week before the project is due, so hopefully, that'll help us with tying loose ends long before the     project is due.    <br><br><b>6. What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>     <br><br>My tip of the week is to start early on coding projects! Save yourself the undue stress by giving     yourself adequate time to finish the task at hand.</p>
